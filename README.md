## Intro

<br>

Monster Hunt is a challenging Web App game where user takes on a role of hunter and quest for monsters to slay. The more beasts fallen down, the better arms gained by the player to beat bigger and badder foes!

<br>

Monster Hunt project was developed in ReactJS and accelerated with backend infrastructure set in Cloud Firestore by Firebase. Moreover Firebase Authentication was used to build secure authentication system for the application.

<br>

Our team of five developers created Monster Hunt game during Junior Frontend Developer Bootcamp organised by [infoShare Academy](https://github.com/infoshareacademy).

<br>

## Process

<br>

In the process of developing Monster Hunt we used JIRA for project management and follow SCRUM principles.

During several design meetings we managed to create an initial visualization of our application in Excalidraw.

In Monster Hunt users can register or log in as registered user. On registration user can pick from variety of races and set their own character. Each race has unique statistics like strength,.......... which determine future fight.
After setting up statistics user may acces main menu in which can choose Character View Page, Store Page, Hunting Screen, Our Teem, Chat or log out.
